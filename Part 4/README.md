## 4.1 Neural Networks
Check out the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/uwrov/Training-Project/blob/master/Part%204/model/mnist.ipynb) about machine learning.

There's a lot about neural networks to learn, and our notebook isn't even close to being comprehensive. Machine learning hasn't been a strong focus of our club in years past, so don't stress too much about trying to learn everything there is to know about neural networks.

## 4.2 Camera Control
Check out the [controller README](https://github.com/uwrov/Training-Project/blob/master/Part%204/controller/README.md).
