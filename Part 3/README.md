# Part 3 - Publishers and Subscribers

Working file for [`key_input.py`](https://github.com/uwrov/Training-Project/blob/master/src/wb/scripts/key_in.py).

Working file for ['wb_plugin.cc`](https://github.com/uwrov/Training-Project/blob/master/src/wb/plugins/wb_plugin.cc).

## 3.1 Publishers
Read through [`key_input.py`](https://github.com/uwrov/Training-Project/tree/master/Part%203/publisher).

## 3.2 Subscribers
Read through [`wb_plugin.cc`](https://github.com/uwrov/Training-Project/tree/master/Part%203/subscriber).

`wb_plugin.cc` is a really intimidating file - it's written in C++ and contains a lot of math calculations. Don't worry if you don't fully understand C++ or the calculations, the most important part is that you come away with an understanding on how a ROS Subscriber functions.
