# Build a Robot with ROS
Welcome to UWROV! Over the course of this project we'll do our best to teach you what you need to know to develop for the ROV.

## Part 1 - The Big Picture
In this part you will learn about:
  - A big picture model of how our ROV is controlled
  - What ROS is, and why we want to learn about it
  - What this project will be

## Part 2 - Building a Basic Robot
In this part you will learn about:
  - Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)
  - Xacro
  - Gazebo

## Part 3 - Keyboard Control
In this part you will learn about:
  - ROS Subscribers/Listeners
  - Gazebo Plugins

## Part 4 - Camera Control
In this part you will learn about:
  - Neural Networks
  - OpenCV

## Part 5 - What's Next?
You've finished the robot! Reflect on what you've learned and how cool you are.
There's still a whole lot to learn about though! Here are some areas we'll need to continue improving on:
  - Computer vision for the autonomy tasks
  - Creating an interface to control our actual ROV
